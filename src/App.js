         <h1>How React Works?</h1>
         <p>One of the qualities of React is its Simplicity.
 It is core JavaScript It also uses a special syntax called JSX Allows us to write 100% HTML inside JavaScript.
 React is not just a web application, The funny thing is that it also makes all the nice mobile applications Goes.UseState: 
First we have the functional component which does not support state.
 In other words a functional component is a stateless component Noe with Hooks we have the functional component but stateful it is achieved by using useState.

<h1>
Whats is the difference between props and state ?</h1>
<p>
The Main difference is props are read only and state can be changes asynchronous and props can not be modified but state can be modified using this.
setState , And also you can store data using State but you can't store data using props , props used just for send data , 
and state used for store data props is sending method and state as like a bucket where you can store all kind of data.
